= Introduction =

This page describes how to make translations of the GPS-Running and related plugins.

= Details =
The translation strings are stored in a Google SpreadSheet. CurrentlySeveral plugins currently use the same spreadsheet, just separate tabs: https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=tNZna7OU_2RlRYv5Iv_csgg
To get access to write to the Spreadsheet, contact the project owner (PM ST user gerhard with your email address).

Use marker ##NOTRANSLATE## if a string should not be translated (for instance the name of the plugin).

The spreadsheets are stored with the code, so if the the weblink does not work, there are copies. If you do not have write access or prefer offline editing, create an issue for the updated project and store the spreadsheet there.

General question, create issues. PM/email at other questions. 

Note: ApplyRoutes, Garmin Fitness and other plugins have a similar setup.

= Hints =

Some fitness related items have no generally accepted translation. There may not be a "perfect" translation. To get hints, you can peek at other plugins translations.
